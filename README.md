### Steps to run the application:
- open the jupyter notebook
- load the data
- Either execute all the cells or Execute the last 4 cells in the ipynb notebook (loads the model for detection)
- The last code cell opens your webcam to test the application in realtime
- Test the application using the above sign language and see if the system detects accurately
- To exit out of the application, interupt your kernal
